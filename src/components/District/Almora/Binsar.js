                        Binsar was the summer capital of the Chand Kings, who ruled over Kumaon from the 11th to the 18th centuries AD. The British also used it as a summer capital, and built several estates inside the forest. In 1988, Binsar was established as a sanctuary for the conservation and protection of the shrinking broad leaf oak (Quercus) forests of the Central Himalayan region. It has over 200 species of birds.
