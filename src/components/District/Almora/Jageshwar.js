                        Jageshwar Dham is known as one of Jyotirlinga, Astham Jyotirlingas - Nagesham Darukavane. In many traditional scriptures, it is revered as one of twelve original Jyotirlingams. It is also known as Valley of Gods & dates back from 7th to 14th centuries in it's different forms of reconstruction. The original temple is believed to be constructed by Adi Shankaracharya. It was customary for pilgrims on way to Kailash Mansarovar route to stop and worship Lord Shiva here and seek his blessings.

                        This area was also centre of Lakulisha Shaivism, a revivalist sect worshipping Lord Shiva. Saint Lakulisha, name literally meaning, club-bearing Lord, was a wandering ascetic who is considered to have united different sects and revived worship of Lord Pashupati. This faith later flourished under Bharashiva and Vakataka dynasties of southern and central India. Piligrims who came after Saint Lakulisha considered Lakulisha as the last of twenty-eight incarnations of Lord Shiva, as mentioned in the Puranas. Jageshwar Temples, also referred to as Jageswar Temples or Jageshwar Valley Temples, are a group of 125 ancient Hindu temples dated between 7th and 14th century.

                <h3>Location</h3>
                <div className='distt-subpage-desc'>
                    Jageshwar is located 36 kilometres (22 mi) northeast of Almora, in the Kumaun region. The temples site is on the south of the road, across which is an eponymous village at an altitude of 1,870 m, in the Jataganga river valley near a Deodar forest. The temple clusters begin starting from satellite road branching off east from the Artola village on the Almoraâ€“Pithoragarh highway, at the confluence of two streams Nandini and Surabhi after they flow down the hills in the narrow valley. The site is about 3.5 kilometres  long along the Jataganga rivulet, is a narrow forested valley of oaks, deodara, rhododendrons and pines. Around the valley is human habitation which provide services to the pilgrims and travelers visiting these temples or passing through to other sacred sites in the Uttarkhand region. The resident villages are Mokshadham, Dandeshwar, Jageshwar and Koteshwar.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <div className='distt-subpage-desc'>
                    <div className='br'>
                        The origins of the Jageshwar temples site are unclear. Its remote location has limited its studies and scholarly attention. The site shows evidence of different architectural styles and building periods for both temples and stone steles, which range from the 7th to the 12th century, and then in the modern times.  Estimates for the same temple or stele varies widely, sometimes 1,400 years. According to the ASI, some belong to the post-Gupta or the second half of 1st millennium while others belong to the 2nd millennium. Some colonial-era guesses attribute them to the Katyuri or Chand hill dynasties but there is no textual or epigraphical evidence to support or refute these proposals.  Another prevailing theory is that Adi Shankara built some of these temples, but once again there is no textual or epigraphical evidence to support this claim. Instead, the architectural features and style of some of these Hindu temples is from early 7th century, which is about 50 to 100 years before Adi Shankara lived.

                        The lack of systematic studies of Indian temples and ruins in many parts of the remote Himalayan regions limits what can be said about the chronological sequence of monuments in the Jageshwar valley. According to Chanchani, it is likely that the valley had reached a prominent position in Indian architecture by the 10th century, with the earliest monuments from the 7th-century.

                    The valley has two major clusters of Hindu temples and a number of roadside shrines. Of these some 151 temples have been numbered by ASI as protected pre-12th century monuments. The two largest groups are locally called as the Dandeshwar group temples (Dandeshwar samuh mandir, 15 temples) and the Jageshwar group temples (Jageshwar samuh mandir, 124 temples). Of these, temple number 37, 76 and 146 are the largest, all dated to the late centuries of the 1st millennium.

                <h3>Jageshwar Temples</h3>
                <div className='distt-subpage-desc'>
                    <div className='br'>
                        The Jageshwar group of temples are similar to some large historic cluster of Hindu temples found on the Indian subcontinent. For example, a similar cluster is seen near Bhubhaneswar, Odisha at the Lingaraja group of temples. Another large group of stone temples is illustrated at the Batesvar complex in Chambal valley of Madhya Pradesh. Almost all the small and large temples in the Jageshwar valley, states Chanchani, have a "simple square plan sanctums bounded by plain walls and tiered superstructures".

                    <div className='br'>
                        The temples are atypical than other Hindu temples build after the 6th-century. The Jageshwar temples have a design that deliberately does not anticipate their use as house of worship. The sanctum space in most temples is generally too small (~ 3 square feet) that a priest cannot sit inside, leave alone move around to complete a ritual. Further, most of the lingas do not provide for a drain from abhisheka, a feature that Hindu temples from Gupta and post-Gupta period include. There is no record of their being used for worship, nor traces at the site that would suggest unrecorded use. According to Chanchani, most of these temples may have been memorials to Hindu monks or saints, or part of dedication or grant to the monasteries.
